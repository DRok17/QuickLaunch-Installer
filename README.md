# QuickLaunch-Installer

Originally created by 1upus, QuickLaunch Installer allows you to customize the quick menu shortcuts.
v1.1 now has 6 User customizable slots and 1 default slot.





NOTE

Any customization should be done on a Windows PC, as most of the tools have been provided in the VPK.

Instructions

Install the VPK and select from the pre-made selections, which include the following:

Vita Launcher
Adrenaline
Easy VPK
Vita Grafix
RetroArch
DaldaelusX64
and more...

Selections will be written, and Vita will need to restart.


If customization is needed, plug Vita into PC via USB.
You will need to access to ux0:app/QLINSTALL/z-User-Folders
Select any of the User Folders listed.

PNG Switch and QuickLauncher ID
This batch application will allow easy editting of the file "whatsnew.xml" and swapping PNGs without having to manually rename them.
PNG Switch
Simply delete the PNG app# you want to replace and run the "z-png-switch.bat" file. New PNG will be renamed accordingly.

QuickLauncher ID
Open the z-Replace-ID.bat to access this menu:
Enter a 9 app Title ID and select which number it belongs to.

More Options
If you would like to customize the User slots, please find the files in the zIMG folder under:
ux0:app/QLINSTALL/z-User-Folders



Images
All PNGs need to be 282 x 108. If you would like to title it, I've placed a Pixlr X file in the VPK for easy customization.
